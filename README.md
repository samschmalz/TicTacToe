# TicTacToe

This is just my attempt at creating a TicTacToe game.  I've done it with guidance in a Java class, but that was over a year ago and I'd like to see what I can do on my own.

This is a very rudimentary version of Tic-Tac-Toe. It's basically a virtual tic-tac-toe board for PvP use, no computer opponent at the moment.  That might be something I will add in the future, but for now I am simply going to optimize what I have.  AI will probably be a different file that I will import into the current one.

It's mostly a learning project for me to learn  application programming with Python as well as using version control(github).
